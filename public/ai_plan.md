# On going:

✅ AI Merchant Insights = Guide merchants with actionable insights
What the AI does
It takes raw marketplace + token data and turns it into clear, specific, actionable advice for merchants:
“Increase price by 1 LCUSD to maximize revenue.”
“Your LOCAL-CRAFT token volume grew 18% this week — restock inventory.”
“Withdraw 20% of liquidity; pool volatility is rising.”
“These 3 products underperformed — consider discounts.”
Merchants never deal with charts or analytics — they get simple business guidance.

Also:
Predicts near-future buyer demand and pre-positions liquidity before transactions occur.
Essentially a predictive market-making model that keeps TON ↔ LCUSD swaps smooth and instant.
