🤖 HFT Bots / Liquidity Providers — Deep Dive
Purpose

The HFT bots act as autonomous liquidity agents that keep the marketplace liquid, prices stable, and trades instant.
They continuously monitor TON-based DEXs (like DeDust and StonFi) — and LocalMarket’s own internal AMM — to detect price inefficiencies and execute micro-arbitrage trades in milliseconds.

These bots serve three main roles:

Price Stabilization — maintain tight spreads between LCUSD, TON, and product tokens.

Instant Settlement — supply liquidity instantly when user pools are low.

Yield Generation — earn profits from small spreads, trading fees, and LOCAL token rewards.

How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Market Data Aggregation

The bot subscribes to on-chain and off-chain price feeds:

DeDust & StonFi order books (via APIs/WebSocket).

LocalMarket AMM pool state (on-chain).

Pyth oracle prices for TON and LCUSD.

Builds a real-time price matrix of token pairs:

MANGO-TOKEN/LCUSD  
LCUSD/TON  
TON/MANGO-TOKEN

2. Arbitrage Opportunity Detection

The bot continuously compares prices across markets:

Δ = |Price_A - Price_B| 
if Δ > threshold: trigger trade


Example:

MANGO-TOKEN costs 9.95 LCUSD on LocalMarket AMM

But 10.05 LCUSD on DeDust
→ Bot buys at 9.95, sells at 10.05 → earns 1% spread.

3. Execution Layer

Uses off-chain microservices (Python/Node) connected via TON SDK.

Batch submits atomic swap transactions to AMM smart contract or DEX router.

Executes high-frequency trades (every few seconds/minutes).

Maintains open liquidity positions to minimize gas overhead.

4. Liquidity Provisioning

Bot also functions as a market maker:

Supplies both sides of liquidity pools (LCUSD ↔ product tokens).

Dynamically adjusts position based on predicted demand (from AI Matching Engine).

Keeps pool depth balanced to prevent large price impact.

5. Reward & Settlement

Every profitable trade:

Adds spread profit to bot’s balance.

Earns swap fees (e.g., 0.3% of transaction).

Receives LOCAL token emission (governance reward).

Periodic settlements:

Auto-compounds profits into liquidity pools (yield farming).

Reports activity metrics to DAO for transparency.

Bot Example Scenario

A buyer wants to purchase 10 LCUSD worth of mangoes, but LocalMarket AMM has low LCUSD liquidity.
The HFT bot detects higher LCUSD availability on DeDust, sources liquidity there, and instantly fills the buyer’s trade.
It earns a small spread + trading fee + LOCAL reward for stabilizing the market.

In Simple Terms

Your HFT bot is the invisible backbone of LocalMarket —
it keeps the marketplace fast, liquid, and fair, ensuring every mango, craft, or service token always has a stable, instantly tradable price.
